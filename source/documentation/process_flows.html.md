# Process flows

![A high level process map for EMCS API](/images/emcs-api-high-level-process-map.png)

Detailed process flows for the new RESTful API are still in development.

As the functionality of the API remains similar to the SOAP API, you should use the [process flows in the existing DDNEA documentation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emcs-functional-stage-31-fs31-technical-specifications). 

Ignore any references to SOAP or SOAP envelopes, the new API is RESTful.
