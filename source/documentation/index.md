Version 0.1 issued August 2023
***


## Document summary

This document is the first part of the technical interface specification (TIS) for direct trader input (DTI) to Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS).

It shows the processes involved in the exchange of messages between traders and EMCS during excise movements, and provides definitions, formats and validations of those messages.


## Introduction

Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) is a UK and EU-wide computer system thatâ€™s used to record duty suspended movements of excise goods taking place within the UK and the EU.

EMCS captures and processes information about the movements online, validates the data entered and allows real time notification of the dispatch and receipt of duty suspended excise goods.

It allows the exchange of secure online messages containing specific consignment and movement information between UK and EU trading partners.
