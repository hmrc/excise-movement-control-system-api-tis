# Validation rules and error codes
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>

Some IE messages sent and received through the new EMCS API have XML schema validation rules against them.

The [EMCS validation rules workbook (.XLSX, 105KB)](../downloads/emcs-validation-rules-workbook-17-November-2023.xlsx) contains the business rules and error codes for each message with XML schema validation rules.

Updated rules are highlighted in red.
