## R213
A Control Report IE717 exists in the system (including the case that it is encapsulated in a received IE934) having the same &lt;Control Report Reference&gt;with that of the submitted message. In addition if the ARC is provided in the submitted message then it coincides with the ARC of the referenced Control Report IE717.
