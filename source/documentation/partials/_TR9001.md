## TR9001
Action identification is identification for the occurrence within the Information Exchange Message.   
Although the content of the Action identification can be chosen freely by the producer of the change,   
it must be unique within the scope of the transaction.   
This is a technical attribute added to identify the occurrence in the enclosing transaction (message)   
and intended to enable unique definition of error cases.
