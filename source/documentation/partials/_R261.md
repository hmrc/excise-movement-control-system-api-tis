The applicable 'Submission Type Codes' for Duty Suspension movements are:  
'1 - Standard Submission'  
   
The applicable 'Submission Type Codes' for Duty Paid B2B movements are:  
'3 - Submission for Duty Paid B2B'  
   
Note: The distinction between Duty Paid B2B and Duty Suspension movements should be derived from the ARC structure or based on the &lt;Submission Message Type&gt; in case of IE815, where the ARC is not available.
