## R030
The format of &lt;ARC&gt; is defined as per the below structure:   
   
Field / Content / Field type / Examples  
1 / Year / Numeric 2 / "05"  
2 / Identifier of the MS where the e-AD/e-SAD was initially submitted / Alphabetic 2 / "ES"  
3 / Nationally assigned, unique code / Alphanumeric 15 (digits and capital letters) / "7R19YTE17UIC8J4"  
4 / Type of Movement / Alphanumeric 1 / "P"  
5 / Check Digit / Numeric 1 / "9"  
   
Field 1 is last two digits of year of formal acceptance of movement.  
Field 2 is taken from the list of &lt;NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS&gt;.  
Field 3 must be filled with a unique identifier per EMCS movement. The way this field is used is under MSAs" responsibility, but each EMCS movement must have a unique number.  
Field 4 gives an identifier for the type of the movement. If &lt;Submission Message Type&gt; is "3", then value "P" must be used  
Field 5 gives the Check Digit for the whole ARC (see section "Design Principles" of the DDNEA main document), that will help detect an error when keying the ARC.  
   
Note: Field 4 gives an identifier for the type of the movement. If &lt;Submission Message Type&gt; is "3", then value "P" must be used (the introduced logic is applicable for ARCs generated after 01/01/2023. Any ARCs generated before 01/01/2023 are associated with a Duty Suspension movement, regardless of the alphanumeric character specified in 'Field 4' of the ARC.
