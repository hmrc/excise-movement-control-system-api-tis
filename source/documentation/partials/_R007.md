   The IE consists of top level Data Groups. Each top level Data Group has its own Data Group ACTION which attributes apply to the top level Data Group and its subsequent sub Data Groups. The sender of the IE will always (in case of Create, Update, Invalidate and Delete) send all values of the occurrence.  The &lt;Operation&gt; attribute is used to indicate what action is applied to the occurrence in the IE. Its value is: "C" (Create), "U" (Update), "I"(Invalidate) and "D" (Delete). The &lt;Activation date&gt; indicates when the operation will become applicable for the specific occurrence.
