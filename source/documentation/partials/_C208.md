## C208
IF it is related to a Duty Paid B2B movement  
THEN  
&lt;Tax Warehouse Reference&gt; is N/A  
ELSE  
&lt;Tax Warehouse Reference&gt; is 'R'  
   
Note: The distinction between Duty Paid B2B and Duty Suspension movements should be derived from the ARC structure or based on the &lt;Submission Message Type&gt; in case of IE815, where the ARC is not available.
